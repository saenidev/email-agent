Update Node.js to 20.9.0+ (required)\n2. Update TypeScript to 5.1.0+\n3. Run `npx @next/codemod@canary upgrade latest`\n\n### Phase 2: React 19 Migration\n1. Update react/react-dom to ^19.0.0\n2. Update @types/react and @types/react-dom\n3. Refactor 25 forwardRef components to use ref prop directly\n4. Run `npx codemod@latest react/19/migration-recipe`\n\n### Phase 3: Next.js 16 Migration\n1. Turbopack is now default (no action - simple config)\n2. `next lint` removed - migrate to direct ESLint\n3. Async Request APIs - already using client components (minimal impact)\n\n### Phase 4: Package Updates\n**Radix UI - Update to 1.1.x+ for React 19:**\n- @radix-ui/react-dialog: ^1.0.5 → ^1.1.x\n- @radix-ui/react-separator: ^1.0.3 → ^1.1.x\n- @radix-ui/react-slot: ^1.0.2 → ^1.1.x\n- @radix-ui/react-switch: ^1.0.3 → ^1.1.x\n- @radix-ui/react-tabs: ^1.0.4 → ^1.1.x\n- @radix-ui/react-tooltip: ^1.0.7 → ^1.1.x\n\n**Other packages:**\n- TanStack Query v5: Already compatible (\u003e=18.2.0)\n- Zustand v4: Compatible, consider v5 migration\n- lucide-react: Use --legacy-peer-deps flag\n- Tailwind: Update PostCSS config for v4 (optional)\n\n### Risk Assessment\n- **Low Risk**: TanStack Query, Zustand, Tailwind\n- **Medium Risk**: React.forwardRef refactoring (25 components)\n- **Low Risk**: Turbopack (simple config, no webpack customizations)\n- **Low Risk**: Radix UI (version bumps only)\n\n### Upgrade Commands\n```bash\n# 1. Run automated codemod\nnpx @next/codemod@canary upgrade latest\n\n# 2. Update Radix UI packages\npnpm update @radix-ui/react-dialog @radix-ui/react-separator @radix-ui/react-slot @radix-ui/react-switch @radix-ui/react-tabs @radix-ui/react-tooltip\n\n# 3. Run React 19 codemod\nnpx codemod@latest react/19/migration-recipe ./apps/web\n\n# 4. Fix any lucide-react peer dep issues\npnpm install lucide-react --legacy-peer-deps\n```\n\n### Estimated Effort\n- Pre-migration: 1-2 hours\n- React 19 migration: 2-4 hours (mostly forwardRef)\n- Next.js 16 migration: 1-2 hours\n- Testing: 2-4 hours\n- **Total: ~1 day**","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"saenidev@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-14T16:17:41.306872+09:00","created_by":"saenidev","updated_at":"2026-01-14T16:26:08.253141+09:00","closed_at":"2026-01-14T16:26:08.253141+09:00","close_reason":"Migration plan documented with detailed phases, package updates, and commands","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"email-agent-8bl","depends_on_id":"email-agent-76p","type":"child-of","created_at":"2026-01-14T16:17:55.849968+09:00","created_by":"saenidev"},{"issue_id":"email-agent-8bl","depends_on_id":"email-agent-6lz","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-14T16:18:03.07499+09:00","created_by":"saenidev"},{"issue_id":"email-agent-8bl","depends_on_id":"email-agent-1r0","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-14T16:18:03.266705+09:00","created_by":"saenidev"},{"issue_id":"email-agent-8bl","depends_on_id":"email-agent-xon","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-14T16:18:03.435967+09:00","created_by":"saenidev"},{"issue_id":"email-agent-8bl","depends_on_id":"email-agent-3nc","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-14T16:18:03.621414+09:00","created_by":"saenidev"},{"issue_id":"email-agent-8bl","depends_on_id":"email-agent-dun","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-14T16:18:03.767707+09:00","created_by":"saenidev"}]}
